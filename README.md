MY Project: Web Calculator



Description:
-> I used html , CSS and JavaScript to make this web calculator.

->I've used js for the functioning as a real man made calculator.But i've only added some basic components of arithmatic operatiions like +,-,* and/.
I know the real calculator includes other functions though.

->So i'ill try to add up more components to make it more suntioning as per our calculation needs in the future.

->I've faced some problem while setting up the positions of the buttons so if i find a way to add up at a better position i'll update it.
