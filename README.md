Project title: Web Calculator
Descriptiom:
->My project is all about a web calculator using html, CSS and JavaScript
->I used js to make it as a real tiime working calculator but ive just added the basic components just for some basic arithmetic operations.
->I've faced some issue regarding settting up the position of the last node(0) and second last node(=) as this is my first time of doing this project..if possible ill try to makes changes of that positions in future.
